* Notes
*This quantity of adobo sauce doesn't add heat, just flavor. Save the remainder of the can by refrigerating for a few weeks, or place the contents in a sealable container and freeze it for a few months.

=== Instructions
. Finely dice the onion.
. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes until translucent, stirring occasionally. Add the rice and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the salsa, adobo sauce, broth, and kosher salt.
. Bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes until all the liquid is cooked out. Remove from the heat and allow to stand for 5 minutes to steam. Fluff with a fork and serve.
