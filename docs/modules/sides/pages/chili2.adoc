FOR THIS RECIPE YOU'LL NEED:

MEAT:
2.5 lbs 80/20 ground beef

AROMATICS:
1 large white onion, small diced
5-6 cloves garlic, pressed

TOMATO BASE:
2 cans (14.5 oz each) diced tomatoes, drained
1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce
1 can (28 oz) fire-roasted tomatoes
2 smoked chipotle peppers in adobo
3 tbsp tomato paste

SPICES:
1/2 cup chili powder
1/4 cup paprika
1.5 tbsp ground cumin
1 tsp chili flakes

FLAVOR BOOSTERS:
2 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1.5 tbsp beef bouillon paste (e.g., Better Than Bouillon)
4 tsp hot sauce (e.g., Frank's RedHot)
2 tsp salt (plus more to taste)

BEANS:
4 cans (16 oz each) kidney beans, drained

LIQUID:
Water or beef stock (as needed to adjust thickness)

== Directions

1. **Broil the Beef:** Flatten the ground beef into a thin, even sheet on a large sheet tray. Broil on high (about 8 inches from the heat) for 8–10 minutes until the top is deeply browned and slightly charred. Let it cool, then crumble it into small pieces, keeping the rendered fat/juices.
2. **Prep the Tomatoes:** Use an immersion blender to blend the fire-roasted tomatoes and the 2 chipotle peppers until smooth.
3. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large pot over medium heat, add olive oil, diced onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Sweat for 5–6 minutes until the onions are completely softened.
4. **Toast Spices:** Add the chili powder, paprika, cumin, and chili flakes. Stir and toast for 20–30 seconds to bloom the spices (be careful not to burn them).
5. **Build the Base:** Stir in the blended tomato mixture, tomato sauce, drained diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Scrape the bottom of the pot to incorporate any stuck spices.
6. **Add Seasonings:** Add the hot sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, cider vinegar, beef bouillon, and salt. Simmer for 5 minutes.
7. **Combine:** Add the crumbled beef (and its juices) and the drained kidney beans to the pot. Simmer for at least 10 minutes to let the flavors meld.
8. **Adjust & Serve:** If the chili is too thick, add a splash of water or stock. Taste and adjust with more salt, vinegar, or sugar if needed. Serve with toppings like sour cream, cheddar cheese, and diced onions.
